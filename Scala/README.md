Q1. Use kmeans to cluster the movies using the ratings given by the user, that is, use the item-user matrix from itemusermat File provided as input to your program.

Q2. Using spark MLlib, use the supervised learning (decision tree and Naive Bayes) algorithms to classify types of glass based on the dataset “glass.data”

Q3. Use Collaborative filtering find the accuracy of ALS model accuracy. Use ratings.dat file. 
It contains 
User id ::  movie id :: ratings :: timestamp.  
Your program should report the accuracy of the model.
